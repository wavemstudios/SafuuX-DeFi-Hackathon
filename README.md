# Cosmic Force Hackathon Entry

## This fork is the start of the Cosmic Force repository.

### BACKGROUND:
3 years ago WavemStudios created Cosmic Force, an 8-Bit Retro Shoot Em Up game for the Commodore 64 and PC emulators. Now we want to create a AAA release of the game with all the latest technology that also links into the blockchain.

Created for Unreal Engine 5 we will be utilising an in game token, NFT’s, game treasury, game development treasury, game escrow, in game marketplace, rewards, in and out exchange to SafuuX and variable exchange rate to tie into the SafuuX rebase.

### AIM:
To create a set of gaming contracts to be used within the Cosmic Force game with SafuuX Builderkit.

Create Web3 frontend for game account status viewing, leader table and game marketplace.

Create Unreal Engine 5 Plugin to connect directly with the Cosmic Force DeFi Smart Modules. Make some of the standard game functionality available for 3rd party game developers to connect via Web3 and Unreal Engine 5.

### GAMEPLAY:
Gameplay will include traditional space shoot em up style, challenge stages, land vehicle race/combat and 3rd person direct combat with the aliens.

Players will be enrolled as a Cadet and work your way up the ranks first with Basic Simulator Training then Advanced Training then to Missions and full combat.

After completing basic training to a required standard you will be issued a standard release Star Fighter (NFT) with options to upgrade in the form of rewards or paid for upgrade.

Colonies will be created to mine rare materials from initially 6 planets. Purchase of land, building pods and mining equipment for mining the land and gaining rewards will be available.

During training you will decide which colony you want to defend and become a part of. Colonies will run their own DAO for voting colony wide purchases and upgrades of defence systems. Cosmic Force will grow over time and be driven partly by the community and the universe expands.

### ADITIONAL FEATURES:
Daily rewards for active users.

Challange races for bonus tokens (Dogfight!).

Land ownership and building sub mining colonies.

Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) voting.

In-game asset ownership with NFT blockchain tecnology.

### HOW COSMIC FORCE HELPS THE SAFUUX COMMUNITY:

Every in-game transaction that writes to the blockchain will pay gas fees for SafuuX and the community.

A percentage of every NFT sale will go to SafuuX to be used potentially to help onboard new applications bringing even more transactions and fees to the SafuuX community.

NFT’s will be available to buy and sell within the SafuuX NFT marketplace bringing in fees to the SafuuX community.

Cosmic Force aims to be featured on the Epic Games Store that currently has around 200 million users bringing new gamers from outside to eventually become SafuuX community members.
